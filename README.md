# using-Mobile-Application-For-voting-system
Now a days electronic voting is a good practice, although it contains some issues like long lingering lines, time  consumption, registration process being tedious and lack security; due to which people may not turn up at polling station in fear  of been bullied to vote someone else they don’t wish to. The proposed project is based on mobile voting application. Mobile-base  voting application can prevent above issues and it is the most secure way to vote as it contains fingerprint and face verification  technique. In this proposed project the user to registers with application. Further the user will have to provide details along with  his fingerprints or face-scan according to user’s desire. Post registration the user will authenticate themselves by providing  fingerprint or face-scan; if the fingerprint or face-scan matched with that of the stored in Firebase then and only then the user is  authenticated, hence user need not remember any password in order to log in to application. This will reduce the complex task of remembering the password and increase the security as the bio-metric is unique to every person. The proposed architecture is  expected to provide secured access to only authenticated users of a system within a short period of time and prohibit violators  from gaining any access. This purposed system prevents duplication of vote and allow voter to vote in their comfort zone.
